# 🐍 Day 2: Control Flow, Loops & Data Structures

Welcome to Day 2 of my Python learning journey!  
Today I focused on **loops**, **lists**, **tuples**, **sets**, and **dictionaries** along with logic-building through problems and a mini project.

---

## ✅ Topics Covered:
- `for` and `while` loops
- `break`, `continue`, `pass`
- Nested loops and pattern building
- Lists and common list methods
- Tuples and immutability
- Dictionaries and key-value access
- Sets and uniqueness
- Intro to logic-based problem solving

## 📚 Concepts Practiced:
- `range(start, stop, step)`
- Loop control: `if`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`
- Avoiding infinite loops
- Logic-based iteration and validation
- Mutable vs immutable types
- Dictionary `.get()`, `.items()`, key-value logic
- Sets for fast uniqueness checks
- List slicing, indexing, and methods

## 🚀 Mini Project: Number Guessing Game
A CLI-based game where the computer selects a number and the user tries to guess it with feedback after each guess.

**Features:**
- Random number generation
- Loop for user attempts
- Range narrowing hint system
- Win counter and attempt tracking
