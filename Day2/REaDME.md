# 🐍 Day 2: Control Flow, Loops & Data Structures

Welcome to **Day 2** of my Python learning journey!  
Today I deepened my understanding of **loops**, **lists**, **tuples**, **sets**, and **dictionaries** while working on logic-based problems and building two mini projects.

---

## ✅ Topics Covered:
- `for` and `while` loops  
- Loop control: `break`, `continue`, `pass`  
- Nested loops and pattern generation  
- Lists and list methods (`append`, `remove`, `copy`, etc.)  
- Tuples and immutability  
- Dictionaries: key-value access, `.get()`, `.items()`  
- Sets and uniqueness  
- Difference between shallow copy and assignment  
- Simple file I/O introduction  
- Logic building with iterations and conditionals

## 🚀 Mini Projects

### 🎯 Mini Project 1: Number Guessing Game
A terminal-based game where the computer selects a number between 0 and 100 and the user has to guess it. After each guess, the range is narrowed based on the guess.

**Features:**
- Random number generation (`random.randint`)  
- Input validation  
- Feedback loop  
- Range narrowing after each attempt  
- Tracks number of attempts

---

### 📝 Mini Project 2: To-Do List CLI App
A command-line task manager where the user can add, view, complete, and delete tasks.

**Features:**
- Task storage using a dictionary  
- User input via numbered menu  
- Option to mark tasks as "completed"  
- Ability to delete tasks  
- Scalable structure to add file saving/loading later
