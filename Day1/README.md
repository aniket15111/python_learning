# 🐍 Day 1: Python Basics

Welcome to Day 1 of my Python learning journey!  
Today I focused on setting up my environment and learning the basics of Python syntax, input/output, conditionals, and simple problem-solving.

---

## ✅ Topics Covered:
- Python installation and setup
- Printing and user input
- Variables and data types
- Type conversion
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)

---

## 💻 Scripts Created:

| File                      | Description                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `01_hello_world.py`       | First Python program                         |
| `02_variables_io.py`      | Input/output, variable usage                 |
| `03_conditions.py`        | Basic if-else structure                      |
| `04_even_odd_checker.py`  | Check if a number is even or odd             |
| `05_simple_calculator.py` | Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)     |
| `06_bmi_calculator.py`    | Calculate BMI based on height and weight     |

## 📚 Concepts Practiced:
- String formatting (`f-strings`)
- `input()` and `print()`
- Arithmetic operations
- Conditional logic
- Modular, readable script structure

---

## 🚀 Next Step:
